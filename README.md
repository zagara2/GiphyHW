# Just Desserts

## What is it?

The site uses the Giphy API to generate GIFs of a particular dessert when a user clicks the button with the name of that dessert on it. Alternatively, users have the option to create their own working dessert buttons by typing the name of a dessert in the box provided. Each generated GIF can be animated or paused by clicking on it.

The site is currently deployed at https://zagara2.github.io/GiphyHW/ .

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* JQuery
* APIs
* AJAX

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It works perfectly in all of them.

Plans to test on Safari are upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small to moderately large desktop (between 1280x1024 and 1680x1050), but looks good on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions. 

When the page is loaded properly, it should look like this:

 (the rest of the page is visible if one keeps scrolling)

## Future Plans for Improvement

* Make GIFs display more towards the center of their designated div on mobile.
